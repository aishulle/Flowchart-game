# Flowchart Game

**Flowchart Game** is an interactive web-based application developed using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to help users learn and assess their understanding of processes or systems through flowchart construction. The project consists of two parts:

- `flowchartgame`: The main interface where users solve flowchart-based questions.
- `queryflowchartgame`: A supporting module for managing and querying question data.

---

## User Flow

1. **Display of Available Questions**  
   A list of available questions is presented to the user. (Two sample questions are provided initially.)

2. **Question Selection**  
   Upon selection, the full question and its related components are displayed.

3. **Component Display**  
   Draggable components (representing steps in a process) are shown on either side of the interface.

4. **Flowchart Construction**  
   Users drag and drop components into a designated area to build a flowchart based on the question.

5. **Submission and Evaluation**  
   After completing the flowchart, users can click **"Check My Workflow"** to submit their solution for evaluation.

6. **Feedback and Scoring**  
   The application compares the userâ€™s flowchart with the correct solution and provides feedback along with an accuracy score.

7. **Correct Solution Display **  
   A "Show Correct Solution" button may be used to display the correct flowchart.
